## Description

A Pretty simple utility built with Vue.js to check if a domain is live or down.

Demo at https://skadimoolam.github.io/ping/

There's no back-end where domains' details and their past status are stored.
But there's a JSON file name `data.json`, with which you can customize the sites this app is tracking.



## How does it work

Vue sends a `fetch` request to the specified url, if it returns `status: 200` then it's most likely alright.
To get around `cros` issue, this just sends an opaque request, for which most server respond without the actual
content of their site, but the usual headers are present.


## Usage

Just clone this repo anywhere the browser can reach and update the `data.json` with your sites.

This also has included support for Google Analytics, just switch the Property Id from Google, or you 
remove it completely.


## data.json Configurations

There's not much you can configure, take a look in the code below. Add or remove any site, should work as expected
if not just make an issue here in Github.
``` json
[
  {
    "name": "Google IN",
    "url": "google.co.in",
    "port": 80
  },
  {
    "name": "Facebook",
    "url": "facebook.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Some Random Site",
    "url": "somerandomsite.com",
    "port": 8080
  }
]
```

## Note
I built this tool for use on a server, if you wish to run it locally you need to have some sort of a server installed. One simple option is `npm install -g serve`. Works great with this tool.
